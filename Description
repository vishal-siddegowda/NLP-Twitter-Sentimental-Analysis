Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multiclass classification problems. 
It is called Naive Bayes or idiot Bayes because the calculations of the probabilities for each class are simplified to make their calculations tractable.
Rather than attempting to calculate the probabilities of each attribute value, they are assumed to be conditionally independent given the class value.
This is a very strong assumption that is most unlikely in real data, 
i.e. that the attributes do not interact. Nevertheless, the approach performs surprisingly well on data where this assumption does not hold.
